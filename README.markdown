## Adding a Build Provider
Made a build provider? Great! We'd love to include it in our list! Just follow this step-by-step process and you're provider will make it to our webpage in no time.

- Open the [`_data/providers.yml` file](https://github.com/AtomBuild/atombuild.github.io/blob/master/_data/providers.yml) on GitHub.
- Press the Pencil Icon in the upper Right Corner of the Code Preview.
- Add your provider to the correct category, following the following structure:

```yml
- title: {build-provider}
  url: {build-url}
```
- Save your commit, and submit your pull request.
